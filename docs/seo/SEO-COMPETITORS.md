## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Own the Ridgewood Search (Hometown Advantage)

**Rationale:** 360 Degree Care is headquartered at 27 Chestnut Street, Ridgewood. No national franchise can match this authentic local presence.

**Actions:**
- Create comprehensive "Home Care Ridgewood NJ" content
- Emphasize local headquarters in messaging
- Reference Ridgewood landmarks, community, character
- Note: TLC Companions at 89 Chestnut Street is a neighbor - differentiate clearly

### 2. City-Specific FAQ Content with Schema

**Rationale:** Most competitors have thin city pages. Rich FAQ content with schema can win featured snippets.

**Questions to answer per city:**
- "How much does home care cost in [City], NJ?"
- "Does Medicare cover home health aides in Bergen County?"
- "What's the difference between home care and home health care?"
- "What questions should I ask a home care agency?"

### 3. Review Acquisition Campaign

**Current State:** Senior Helpers has 14 reviews; Applause has strong BBB/Google presence. 360 Degree Care needs comparable social proof.

**Platforms to target:**
- Google Business Profile (primary)
- Caring.com
- Yelp
- A Place for Mom

### 4. Concierge Positioning Differentiation

**Rationale:** Most competitors use generic "home care" language. 360 Degree Care's "concierge home care" is unique.

**Content to create:**
- "What is Concierge Home Care?"
- "How Concierge Care Differs from Standard Home Care"
- Emphasize personalized, premium, locally-rooted service

### 5. Bergen County Senior Living Guide (Content Hub)

**Create authoritative resource covering:**
- Senior centers by city
- Transportation options (ACCESS Link, local services)
- Medicare/Medicaid providers in area
- Support groups and community organizations
- Link internally to service pages for SEO value

### 6. Aggregator Listings

**Required Profiles:**
- A Place for Mom (primary - drives most leads)
- Caring.com (reviews focus)
- Care.com (consumer marketplace)
- Yelp (local search)
