## Executive Summary

- **Clean sitemap** - Reduced from 1,200+ to 122 quality pages
- **LocalBusiness schema** - Properly implemented with correct areaServed hierarchy

- **Fort Lee fully optimized** - Has city-specific FAQs for all 6 services
- **URL structure** - Clean, hierarchical, keyword-rich URLs

### Critical Issues
1. **125 pages "Crawled - not indexed"** - Google visits but rejects these pages
2. **Impressions declining** - From ~1,300/day (Sept) to ~400/day (Dec)
3. **City pages are orphaned** - No internal links from service or county hubs
4. **Missing BreadcrumbList schema** - Lost hierarchy signal to Google

### Quick Wins

2. Add internal links from county hubs to city pages (immediate crawl path)
3. Submit GSC URL removal requests for remaining 51 404s

## GSC Metrics (28 Days)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Impressions | 756 | Very low |
| Total Clicks | 17 | Very low |
| CTR | 2.2% | Above average (good) |
| Average Position | 27 | Page 3 of results |
| Indexed Pages | 34 | Only 28% of sitemap |
| Not Indexed | 378 | Legacy URLs + rejected pages |

### Indexing Issue Breakdown

| Reason | Pages | Action Required |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Crawled - not indexed | 125 | Add unique content, FAQs, internal links |
| Not found (404) | 51 | Add redirects or submit removal requests |
| Page with redirect | 4 | Expected - no action |
| Redirect error | 1 | Investigate and fix |

### Trend Analysis

**Impressions declining significantly:**
- September 2025: ~1,300 impressions/day
- October 2025: ~700 impressions/day
- November 2025: ~500 impressions/day
- December 2025: ~400 impressions/day

This 70% decline suggests Google is reducing the site's visibility, likely due to the "crawled but not indexed" pages being seen as low-quality.

## Content Analysis

### City Page Content Status

| City | Unique Hero | Unique Overview | City FAQs | Local Resources | Internal Links |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Fort Lee | Yes | Yes | Yes (all services) | Yes | **NO** |
| Ridgewood | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Paramus | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Hackensack | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Teaneck | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Fair Lawn | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Englewood | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| Westwood | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |
| River Vale | Yes | Yes | **NO** | NO | **NO** |

**Root Cause of "Crawled - not indexed":**
The 8 non-Fort Lee cities have identical FAQ sections across all pages. Google likely sees these as near-duplicates, explaining why it crawls but refuses to index them.
