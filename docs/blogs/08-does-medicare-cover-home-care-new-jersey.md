One of the most common questions we hear from families at 360 Degree Care is: "Will Medicare pay for this?" The answer is complicated—and often disappointing.

The short version: Medicare has very limited coverage for home care services. Understanding what is and isn't covered can save you frustration and help you plan realistically for your loved one's care.

## The Short Answer

**Medicare does not cover most home care services.**

Specifically, Medicare does not pay for personal care services like bathing assistance, dressing, toileting; companion care or supervision; housekeeping or meal preparation; help with daily activities when that's the only care needed; or long-term custodial care at home.

These are exactly the services most families need when an aging parent can no longer manage independently at home.

Medicare does cover some "home health care"—but the requirements are strict, and the coverage is typically short-term. Understanding [the difference between home care and home health care](/blog/home-care-vs-home-health-care) is essential for navigating coverage.

## What Medicare Does Cover: Home Health Care

Medicare covers home health care under specific conditions. Home health care is different from home care—it involves skilled medical services provided by licensed professionals.

### Requirements for Medicare Coverage

For Medicare to pay for home health services, all of these must be true:

**You must be "homebound."** Medicare defines homebound as being unable to leave home without considerable effort or assistance. Leaving home must require a taxing effort, help from another person, or special equipment. Occasional absences for medical appointments, religious services, or adult day programs are allowed.

**You must need skilled care.** This means services that require a licensed professional—skilled nursing, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. Personal care alone doesn't qualify.

**Care must be medically necessary.** A doctor must determine that you need these services and create a plan of care.

**Care must be part-time or intermittent.** Medicare covers part-time skilled care, not around-the-clock services.

**The agency must be Medicare-certified.** Only certified home health agencies can bill Medicare directly.

### What's Included Under Medicare Home Health

When you qualify, Medicare may cover skilled nursing care such as wound care, injections, IV therapy, catheter management, and health monitoring; physical therapy to restore mobility, strength, and balance; occupational therapy to regain daily living skills; speech therapy for communication or swallowing problems; medical social services to help with care planning and resources; and limited home health aide services, but only when you're also receiving skilled care.

That last point is important. Medicare will pay for a home health aide to help with bathing and personal care—but only as part of a skilled care plan. Once skilled nursing or therapy ends, the home health aide coverage ends too.

### The Typical Medicare Home Health Scenario

Here's how Medicare home health usually works in practice:

Your parent is discharged from the hospital after hip replacement surgery. The doctor orders home health care including skilled nursing to monitor the surgical site and medications, physical therapy to help them regain mobility and strength, and a home health aide to assist with bathing while they recover.

Medicare covers these services for as long as they're medically necessary and your parent remains homebound. After several weeks, your parent recovers well—they can walk independently, the surgical site has healed, and skilled care is no longer needed.

At this point, Medicare coverage ends. But your parent may still need help with daily activities. That ongoing personal care is not covered.

## What Medicare Doesn't Cover

Medicare explicitly does not cover certain home care services, regardless of circumstances.

**24-hour care at home** is not covered by Medicare. Even if your parent needs constant supervision, Medicare won't pay for around-the-clock caregivers.

**Homemaker services** like cleaning, laundry, and meal preparation aren't covered unless they're incidental to covered skilled care.

**Personal care only** means that if your parent needs help bathing, dressing, and toileting but doesn't require skilled nursing or therapy, Medicare won't pay.

**Custodial care** refers to ongoing help with daily activities. Medicare considers this custodial care, not medical care, and doesn't cover it.

**Companion care** and supervision, socialization, and safety monitoring aren't covered medical services under Medicare.

This is the gap that surprises most families. Medicare is health insurance—it covers medical treatment and recovery. It doesn't cover the ongoing support many seniors need to live safely at home.

## Medicare Advantage Plans: Any Better?

Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans are offered by private insurers as an alternative to Original Medicare. Some offer additional benefits, including limited home care coverage.

However, coverage varies dramatically by plan. Some Medicare Advantage plans include a small number of personal care hours, but this is typically very limited (perhaps 20-40 hours per year), restricted to specific circumstances, and subject to plan rules and networks.

If your parent has a Medicare Advantage plan, review the specific benefits carefully. Don't assume it covers what you need—verify it.

## Medicaid: Different Rules

Medicaid—the joint federal-state program for low-income individuals—does cover home care services in New Jersey. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid can pay for personal care assistance, companion services, and help with daily activities.

However, Medicaid has strict financial eligibility requirements. Your parent must have limited income and assets to qualify. For married couples, rules are complex regarding what the healthy spouse can keep.

New Jersey offers several Medicaid waiver programs that provide home and community-based services for eligible individuals, potentially including personal care, respite care, home modifications, and care coordination.

If your parent might qualify financially, or if they need to "spend down" assets to become eligible, consulting with an elder law attorney can help navigate the process.

## Other Ways to Pay for Home Care

Since Medicare doesn't cover most home care, families turn to other sources. For a detailed breakdown of costs and payment options, see our guide on [home care costs in Northern New Jersey](/blog/cost-of-home-care-northern-new-jersey).

### Private Pay

Most home care is paid out-of-pocket. While this represents a significant expense, it provides the most flexibility in choosing services and providers.

### Long-Term Care Insurance

If your parent purchased a long-term care insurance policy years ago, it may cover home care services. Policies vary in what they cover, how much they pay, and what triggers benefits (usually inability to perform a certain number of activities of daily living).

Review the policy carefully. Many families don't realize they have this coverage or don't know how to access it.

### Veterans Benefits

The VA's Aid and Attendance benefit provides monthly payments to eligible veterans and surviving spouses who need help with daily activities. This benefit can be used to pay for home care.

Eligibility requires wartime service, meeting medical needs criteria, and financial thresholds. The application process can be complex, but the benefit is substantial.

### Family Resources

Many families share costs among siblings, use retirement savings, or redirect funds from other expenses to pay for care. Some sell property or other assets. While not ideal, these approaches make care possible for many families.

## Planning Ahead

The best time to plan for long-term care is before you need it. If your parent is still healthy, consider long-term care insurance (though it becomes expensive or unavailable after health problems develop), savings strategies specifically for future care needs, understanding their financial picture so you know what resources exist, and family conversations about wishes and expectations.

If you're already in the midst of needing care, focus on understanding all available resources, getting professional guidance from elder law attorneys or geriatric care managers when needed, and being realistic about costs and how to cover them.
