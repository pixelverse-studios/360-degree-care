Hiring a home care agency is one of the most important decisions you'll make for an aging parent or loved one. The right agency becomes an extension of your family. The wrong choice can lead to stress, turnover, and inadequate care.

With dozens of home care agencies serving Bergen County, Passaic County, and surrounding Northern New Jersey communities, how do you separate the exceptional from the mediocre? You ask the right questions.

At 360 Degree Care, we welcome tough questions from families—it shows you're serious about finding the best care. Below are the 15 questions every family should ask before signing with any home care agency.

## Questions About the Agency Itself

### 1. How long have you been providing home care services in this area?

Experience matters in home care. An established agency has refined its processes, built relationships with local healthcare providers, and developed systems for handling challenges.

**What to listen for:** Specific years of operation, knowledge of local communities, and stability of leadership. A family-owned agency that's been serving Bergen County for years will understand the unique needs of communities from Ridgewood to Fort Lee.

**Red flag:** Vague answers, recent ownership changes, or inability to provide references from long-term clients.

### 2. Are you licensed by the State of New Jersey?

All home care agencies in New Jersey must be licensed by the Department of Health. This isn't optional—it's a legal requirement that ensures basic standards of operation.

**What to listen for:** A clear "yes" with the ability to provide license numbers if requested.

**Red flag:** Hesitation, claims that licensing "isn't required" for their type of service, or inability to verify credentials.

### 3. Are your caregivers employees of your agency, or independent contractors?

This question has significant implications for quality, reliability, and your family's liability.

**What to listen for:** "Our caregivers are W-2 employees." This means the agency handles payroll taxes, workers' compensation insurance, and unemployment insurance. If a caregiver is injured in your loved one's home, you're protected.

**Red flag:** "We use independent contractors" or vague answers about employment status. Independent contractor arrangements can leave families exposed to liability and often indicate less agency oversight.

### 4. What insurance coverage do you carry?

Proper insurance protects everyone involved—your loved one, the caregiver, and your family.

**What to listen for:** General liability insurance, professional liability insurance, workers' compensation coverage, and a fidelity bond (which protects against theft).

**Red flag:** Inability to provide proof of insurance or minimal coverage amounts.

### 5. How do you screen and train your caregivers?

The caregivers entering your loved one's home need to be trustworthy, skilled, and properly trained.

**What to listen for:** Comprehensive background checks (criminal history, reference verification, credential verification), drug screening, skills assessment, and ongoing training requirements. Ask specifically about their process—a quality agency will describe it in detail.

**Red flag:** "We just check references" or reluctance to discuss screening procedures.

## Questions About Caregiver Matching and Quality

### 6. How do you match caregivers with clients?

A technically skilled caregiver isn't enough—personality fit matters enormously for day-to-day happiness and quality of care.

**What to listen for:** A thoughtful process that considers personality, interests, language needs, cultural background, and specific care requirements. The best agencies take time to understand your loved one as a person, not just a list of medical needs.

At 360 Degree Care, we believe this matching process is one of the most important things we do. We're a small, family-run agency specifically because we want to know every client personally—not treat them as a number in the system.

**Red flag:** "We send whoever is available" or no mention of compatibility considerations.

### 7. What happens if we don't get along with our assigned caregiver?

Even with careful matching, sometimes the chemistry isn't right. A good agency makes transitions easy.

**What to listen for:** A clear, no-hassle replacement policy. The agency should be willing to find a better match without making you feel difficult or penalizing you.

**Red flag:** Resistance to caregiver changes, fees for switching, or suggestions that you should "give it more time" when you've expressed clear concerns.

### 8. How do you handle caregiver absences, vacations, or emergencies?

Consistency matters, but so does reliability. What happens when your regular caregiver can't make it?

**What to listen for:** A backup system with caregivers who are familiar with your loved one's care plan, advance notice for planned absences, and 24/7 availability for emergencies.

**Red flag:** "You'll need to find coverage yourself" or no clear backup system.

### 9. Who supervises the caregivers, and how often?

Ongoing supervision ensures care quality doesn't slip over time and catches problems early.

**What to listen for:** Regular supervisory visits (at least monthly), a clear chain of communication, and a named supervisor you can contact with concerns.

**Red flag:** "We trust our caregivers to work independently" without any oversight structure.

## Questions About Care Planning and Communication

### 10. How do you develop and update care plans?

Your loved one's needs will change over time. The agency should have a process for assessing needs and adapting care accordingly.

**What to listen for:** An initial in-home assessment, a written care plan developed with family input, and regular reviews to adjust as needs change. Ask who conducts the assessment and what their qualifications are. [Learn about our approach to care](/about).

**Red flag:** No formal assessment process or care plans that are generic rather than personalized.

### 11. How will you communicate with our family about my loved one's care?

You need to stay informed about your loved one's wellbeing, even if you're not there every day.

**What to listen for:** Regular updates (daily notes, weekly summaries), a system for urgent communications, and a designated point of contact for questions and concerns.

**Red flag:** "We'll call you if there's a problem" with no proactive communication.

### 12. What is your process if my loved one's condition changes or declines?

Health changes happen. A good agency recognizes warning signs and responds appropriately.

**What to listen for:** Training for caregivers on recognizing changes, clear protocols for communicating concerns to family and healthcare providers, and the ability to adjust care levels as needed.

**Red flag:** No clear escalation process or "that would be a hospital matter."

## Questions About Logistics and Costs

### 13. What are your rates, and what's included?

Transparency about costs prevents surprises and builds trust.

**What to listen for:** Clear hourly rates or package pricing, explanation of what's included, and honest discussion of additional costs (if any). Ask about minimum hour requirements, overtime rates, and holiday pricing.

At 360 Degree Care, we provide detailed, personalized quotes after understanding your specific needs. Every family's situation is different, and we believe pricing should reflect the actual care required. For a general overview of what to expect, see our guide on [home care costs in Northern New Jersey](/blog/cost-of-home-care-northern-new-jersey).

**Red flag:** Reluctance to discuss pricing, hidden fees, or rates that seem too good to be true.

### 14. What are your minimum hour requirements and scheduling flexibility?

Care needs vary. Some families need just a few hours of help; others need around-the-clock support.

**What to listen for:** Flexible minimums that work for your situation, ability to adjust schedules as needs change, and responsiveness to last-minute changes when necessary.

**Red flag:** Rigid requirements that don't fit your needs or inability to accommodate schedule changes.

### 15. What is your cancellation and contract policy?

Life is unpredictable. Understand your commitments before you sign anything.

**What to listen for:** Reasonable notice requirements for cancellation, no long-term contracts or ability to cancel without penalty, and clear terms for adjusting service levels.

**Red flag:** Long-term contracts, significant cancellation penalties, or pressure to commit before you're ready.

## Bonus: Questions to Ask Yourself

Beyond questioning the agency, ask yourself:

- **Did they listen more than they talked?** A good agency wants to understand your needs, not just sell their services.
- **Did they seem genuinely interested in my loved one as a person?** Care is personal. The agency should ask about interests, preferences, and personality—not just medical conditions.
- **Did I feel rushed or pressured?** Quality agencies let families make decisions at their own pace.
- **Can I reach someone when I need to?** Test their responsiveness before you sign. If they're hard to reach during the sales process, imagine how they'll be once they have your business.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many agencies should I interview before making a decision?**
We recommend speaking with at least three agencies to compare approaches, personalities, and pricing. Trust your instincts—you'll often know when you've found the right fit.

**Should I involve my loved one in the agency selection process?**
Whenever possible, yes. They'll be the one receiving care, and their comfort with the agency matters. If they can participate in conversations or meet potential caregivers before starting, that's ideal.

**What if I've already hired an agency and I'm not happy?**
You're not stuck. Most agency agreements allow you to end services with reasonable notice. If you're experiencing problems, first try to resolve them with the agency directly. If that doesn't work, don't hesitate to make a change—your loved one's wellbeing is too important.
