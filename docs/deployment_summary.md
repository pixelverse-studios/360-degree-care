## Latest deploy summary
- **Added Local Resources section to city service pages** - New component that displays nearby hospitals, senior centers, pharmacies, and community centers for each city
- **Tracking county hub pages for future indexing** - These pages exist but need re-indexing after content improvements are complete

## Notes for internal team
- Foundation work for SEO content differentiation (360C-144)
- LocalResources component renders as 3-column responsive card grid
- Each card shows: name, type badge, address, and clickable phone number
- Section appears between Benefits and FAQs on city pages
- No content added yet - this is the infrastructure for city-specific content
- County hub pages below were showing as 404 in GSC from old crawls (June 2025)
- Pages now exist but Google hasn't re-crawled them
- DO NOT request indexing yet - wait until content differentiation improvements are deployed
