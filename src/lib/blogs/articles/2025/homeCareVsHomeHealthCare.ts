    content: `If you're researching care options for an aging parent or loved one, you've probably noticed that "home care" and "home health care" are often used interchangeably. But they're not the same thing—and understanding the difference is essential for getting your loved one the right support.

At 360 Degree Care, we help Bergen County and Passaic County families navigate these distinctions every day. Let's clear up the confusion.

## The Simple Distinction

**Home care** (also called non-medical home care or personal care) helps with daily living activities and companionship. No medical license is required to provide these services.

**Home health care** (also called skilled home health) provides medical services in the home. It requires licensed healthcare professionals—nurses, therapists, or other clinicians.

Think of it this way: home care helps your loved one *live comfortably*, while home health care helps them *heal or manage medical conditions*.

## What Home Care Includes

Home care services focus on the non-medical support that helps seniors maintain independence and quality of life at home. These services are provided by trained caregivers, home health aides, or personal care aides.

### Personal Care Assistance

This is often the core of home care services and includes bathing and showering assistance, dressing and grooming help, toileting and incontinence care, mobility assistance and fall prevention, and transferring (bed to chair, etc.). [Learn more about our personal care services](/services/personal-care).

### Companionship and Supervision

Many seniors need someone present not just for physical help, but for safety, social interaction, and mental stimulation. Companionship services include conversation and emotional support, accompaniment on walks or outings, engagement in hobbies and activities, supervision for safety (especially for those with dementia), and transportation to appointments or errands. [Explore our companion care services](/services/companion-care).

### Household Support

Home care also includes light housekeeping that maintains a safe, comfortable living environment: meal planning and preparation, light cleaning and laundry, medication reminders (not administration), grocery shopping, and organizing and tidying.

### When Home Care Is Appropriate

Home care is typically the right choice when your loved one needs help with daily activities but doesn't require medical treatment, is recovering from illness or surgery and needs support while healing, has dementia or Alzheimer's and needs supervision, is isolated and would benefit from companionship, or when family caregivers need respite or supplemental help.

## What Home Health Care Includes

Home health care involves skilled medical services provided by licensed professionals. These services are often prescribed by a physician following hospitalization, surgery, or diagnosis of a condition requiring ongoing medical management.

### Skilled Nursing

Registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) provide wound care and dressing changes, IV therapy and injections, medication management and administration, chronic disease management (diabetes, heart failure, etc.), catheter and ostomy care, vital signs monitoring, and post-surgical care. [Learn about our nursing services](/services/nursing).

### Therapy Services

Licensed therapists help patients recover function and independence through physical therapy (mobility, strength, balance), occupational therapy (daily living skills, adaptive techniques), and speech therapy (communication, swallowing).

### Medical Social Work

Medical social workers help patients and families navigate the healthcare system and connect with resources, including discharge planning, insurance and benefits assistance, care coordination, and counseling and support.

### When Home Health Care Is Appropriate

Home health care is typically needed when your loved one is recovering from surgery, stroke, or serious illness, has chronic conditions requiring medical monitoring, needs wound care or IV medications, requires physical or occupational therapy, or has been discharged from a hospital with skilled care orders.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Home Care | Home Health Care |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Services** | Personal care, companionship, household help | Medical care, therapy, skilled nursing |
| **Providers** | Trained caregivers, HHAs, PCAs | RNs, LPNs, therapists, medical social workers |
| **Doctor's order required** | No | Yes |
| **Medicare coverage** | Typically no | Yes (if qualifying conditions are met) |
| **Duration** | Ongoing, as long as needed | Usually short-term or episodic |
| **Focus** | Quality of life, daily living | Medical treatment, recovery |

## Can You Have Both?

Absolutely—and many families do. The services complement each other well.

Consider this common scenario: Your mother has surgery and comes home with orders for home health care. A nurse visits several times a week to monitor her recovery and manage wound care. A physical therapist comes to help her regain mobility.

But what about the other 23 hours of the day? She still needs help bathing, preparing meals, and getting around safely. That's where home care comes in. A home health aide can provide daily support while the skilled professionals handle medical needs.

Once your mother recovers and no longer needs skilled nursing, she might still benefit from ongoing home care services for personal assistance and companionship.

## How Payment Differs

### Home Care Payment

Home care is typically paid for through private pay (out-of-pocket), long-term care insurance, Medicaid (for those who qualify), and Veterans benefits (Aid & Attendance).

Medicare does **not** cover non-medical home care services—a common point of confusion for families. [Learn more about paying for home care](/how-to-pay) and see our detailed guide on [home care costs in Northern New Jersey](/blog/cost-of-home-care-northern-new-jersey).

### Home Health Care Payment

Home health care is typically covered by Medicare (if doctor-ordered and medically necessary), Medicaid, private insurance, and private pay.

For Medicare to cover home health care, specific conditions must be met: the care must be prescribed by a physician, the patient must be "homebound," and the services must be skilled and medically necessary.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Family

Determining which type of care your loved one needs starts with honest assessment:

**Ask these questions:**

1. Does my loved one have medical needs requiring a licensed professional?
2. What daily activities does my loved one struggle with?
3. Is my loved one safe being alone? For how long?
4. What does their doctor recommend?
5. What can we afford, and what might be covered by insurance?

**Consider a professional assessment.** Many families aren't sure where to start, and that's okay. At 360 Degree Care, we offer consultations to help you understand your options and determine the right level of care.

If your loved one needs medical services, we can work alongside home health providers to ensure comprehensive coverage. If non-medical support is what's needed, we'll create a personalized care plan that addresses their specific situation.

## The Bottom Line

Home care and home health care serve different purposes, but both help your loved one remain safely at home rather than moving to a facility. Many families use both types of service simultaneously or transition between them as needs change.

The most important thing is matching the care to your loved one's actual needs—not over-serving or under-serving. That takes honest assessment and often professional guidance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Medicare cover home care?**
Medicare does not cover non-medical home care (personal care, companionship, housekeeping). It only covers home health care—skilled nursing and therapy—when medically necessary and ordered by a doctor. Many families are surprised by this distinction.

**How do I know if my parent qualifies for home health care?**
Qualification for Medicare-covered home health care requires a doctor's order, a "homebound" status (leaving home is difficult), and a need for skilled nursing or therapy services. Your parent's physician or hospital discharge planner can help determine eligibility.

**Can the same agency provide both home care and home health care?**
Some larger agencies offer both services, while others specialize in one or the other. At 360 Degree Care, we focus on non-medical home care services and coordinate with home health providers when skilled services are also needed.
