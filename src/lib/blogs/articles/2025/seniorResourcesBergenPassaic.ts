If you’re searching for **senior resources Bergen County**, reliable **Passaic County caregiver support**, or other **local senior programs in NJ**, start with the organizations below. Each delivers practical help—transportation, respite, benefits counseling, or dementia guidance—and most collaborate closely with home care agencies like 360 Degree Care.

## 1. Senior Center Networks (Socialization + Meals)

- **Bergen County Division of Senior Services / ADRC** – [co.bergen.nj.us/division-of-senior-services](https://www.co.bergen.nj.us/division-of-senior-services)  
  Operates nine Senior Activity Centers (Englewood, Garfield, Lyndhurst, Mahwah, Midland Park, etc.) with daily congregate meals, wellness classes, and benefits counseling.
- **Passaic County Department of Senior Services** – [passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/human_services/senior_services](https://www.passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/human_services/senior_services)  
  Hosts senior centers in Clifton, Passaic, Paterson, Totowa, and West Milford offering bilingual programming, legal clinics, and SHIP Medicare counseling.

**How to leverage it:** Register seniors for weekly programs to fight isolation, secure low-cost lunches, and get fast referrals to energy assistance, SNAP, or caregiver respite vouchers.

## 2. Adult Day Health + Respite Programs

- **Christian Health Adult Day Services (Wyckoff)** – [christianhealthnj.org/services/adult-day-services](https://www.christianhealthnj.org/services/adult-day-services)  
  Provides medical adult day care with RN oversight, rehabilitation gyms, and dementia-friendly engagement tailored for northern Bergen residents.
- **Preakness Healthcare Center Adult Day Program (Wayne)** – [passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/preakness_healthcare_center](https://www.passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/preakness_healthcare_center)  
  County-operated adult medical day care that blends skilled nursing, therapies, and structured activities for Passaic caregivers who need daytime coverage.

**How to leverage it:** Combine adult day slots with morning/evening home care to cover full-day supervision without paying 24/7 in-home rates.

## 3. Veteran + Military Family Support

- **Bergen County Veterans Services** – [co.bergen.nj.us/veterans-services](https://www.co.bergen.nj.us/veterans-services)  
  Accredited service officers help wartime-era veterans and spouses file for Aid & Attendance, VA healthcare enrollment, and burial benefits.
- **Passaic County Veterans Services** – [passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/veterans-services](https://www.passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/veterans-services)  
  Offers claim prep, transportation coordination to VA facilities, and connections to Veteran Directed Care (VDC) budgets that can fund in-home aides.

**How to leverage it:** Schedule benefits reviews annually; bring care plans and physician notes so officers can document ADL needs that justify pension supplements.

## 4. Dementia + Caregiver Education Networks

- **Alzheimer’s New Jersey – Northern Regional Office** – [alznj.org](https://www.alznj.org)  
  Runs Helpline support, family caregiver workshops, and respite grants dedicated to New Jersey residents—not national call centers.

  Multidisciplinary evaluations, neurologist partnerships, and support groups that guide Bergen and Passaic families through diagnosis and behavior management plans.

**How to leverage it:** Pair in-home care with evidence-based dementia training so caregivers can reinforce routines, wandering prevention, and communication strategies.

## 5. Community Transportation + Mobility

- **Bergen County Community Transportation (BCCT)** – [co.bergen.nj.us/community-transportation](https://www.co.bergen.nj.us/community-transportation)  
  Door-to-door rides for medical appointments, nutrition sites, and shopping within Bergen for adults 60+ or people with disabilities.
- **Passaic County Paratransit / Senior Transportation** – [passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/senior_services/transportation](https://www.passaiccountynj.org/government/departments/senior_services/transportation)  
  Dial-a-ride shuttles covering county medical hubs, dialysis centers, and VA clinics with modest suggested donations.
