Every day, [10,000 baby boomers](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2010/12/29/baby-boomers-retire/) nationwide turn 65, and in New Jersey, the senior population is expected to rise [to 25.6 percent by 2030](https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/news/reports/2013%20State%20Plan%20Final%20for%20Web%20Posting%2012.4.13.pdf), according to the New Jersey Department of Human Services. 

While as a state, we have been busy preparing to fill the workforce gaps left by retiring baby boomers, we are failing to accurately prepare for the care needs of our aging loved ones.

## The Growing Demand for Home Healthcare

[Multiple nationwide studies have shown](https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/aarp-ppi-survey-what-makes-a-community-livable.html) that an increasing number of seniors prefer to remain in their own homes. Compounded by the fact that people are living longer on average, seniors and elderly people are turning to home healthcare now more than ever before.

Home healthcare may be a good option for an individual needing a little more support but wanting to maintain their independence. In many ways, home care is the "concierge service" of aging, with a variety of services that support individuals and their families' unique needs. Often, home healthcare is considered an affordable option.

## The Caregiver Shortage Crisis

New Jersey is facing a caregiver shortage crisis. We currently do not have enough nurses, home aides, physical and occupational therapists and other healthcare professionals to support those who want to remain at home. 

Acute shortages and retention of home health professionals is a serious problem, and this demand is projected to increase astronomically over the next eight years—[41 percent nationally by 2026](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm#tab-6).

### The Numbers Tell the Story

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates [we'll need 1,342,700 aides](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm#tab-6) nationwide in 10 years to keep up with the aging baby boomer population, [up from the existing 911,500 home health aides](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm#tab-6) in 2016.

That's an increase of over 430,000 additional caregivers needed—a massive gap that requires immediate attention and action.

## Building a Sustainable Caregiving Workforce

Sadly, not enough New Jersey residents consider home health care to be a great career option that can be both fulfilling and rewarding. With the required certifications, licensure and experience, nurses, aides and other healthcare workers can support our community, your neighbors and loved ones in many different settings.

### What We Need

We need home care workers who truly find value in caring for others and who are interested in making a difference in the local community. We also need the industry, overall, to understand what motivates caregivers—whether it be:

- **Competitive wages** that reflect the value of their work
- **Professional training programs** that provide ongoing education
- **Opportunities for continued growth** and career advancement
- **Recognition and respect** for the essential services they provide

We are all in this together.

## The Time to Act is Now

The Silver Tsunami is here. Baby boomers have helped to raise us, lead us, and guide us. We owe it to them to ensure that there are enough compassionate caregivers to help them enjoy their retirement to the fullest.

> "The Silver Tsunami represents both a challenge and an opportunity. We must act now to build the caregiving infrastructure our aging population deserves."

The question isn't whether this demographic shift will happen—it's already underway. The question is whether we'll be prepared to meet the needs of our aging loved ones with dignity, compassion, and quality care.
