    content: `You've decided your aging parent needs home care. Now comes the question that keeps many families up at night: How are we going to pay for this?

Home care is a significant expense. In New Jersey, families can spend thousands of dollars monthly depending on the level of care needed. But care is also necessary—your parent's safety and quality of life depend on it.

The good news: more options exist than most families realize. At 360 Degree Care, we've helped Bergen County and Passaic County families navigate these financial waters for years. For an overview of what care costs, see our guide on [home care costs in Northern New Jersey](/blog/cost-of-home-care-northern-new-jersey). Here are seven ways families pay for home care, and how to determine which might work for you.

## 1. Private Pay (Out-of-Pocket)

The most straightforward option is paying directly from personal resources. This is how the majority of home care is funded.

### How It Works

You pay the home care agency directly, typically billed weekly or bi-weekly. Rates are hourly, and you pay only for the hours of care you use.

### Sources of Funds

Families draw on various resources including retirement savings and investments, Social Security and pension income, proceeds from selling assets (a second home, vehicle, valuables), contributions from multiple family members (siblings sharing costs), and redirecting funds from other expenses.

### Advantages

Private pay offers the most flexibility. You choose your provider, services, and schedule without restrictions from insurance or government programs. There's no qualification process or paperwork beyond your agreement with the agency.

### Considerations

Out-of-pocket payment requires sufficient financial resources and can deplete savings over time if care is needed for years. Families should realistically assess how long they can sustain costs.

### Making It Work

Some strategies help stretch private pay resources. Start with fewer hours and increase as needed. Have family members cover gaps in care. Combine paid care with adult day programs. Reassess care levels regularly to ensure you're not overpaying.

## 2. Long-Term Care Insurance

If your parent purchased a long-term care insurance policy years ago, it may be your most valuable resource.

### How It Works

Long-term care insurance policies pay a daily or monthly benefit when the policyholder needs help with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, continence) or has cognitive impairment. Most policies require inability to perform 2-3 activities independently to trigger benefits.

After meeting the policy's elimination period (a waiting period, often 30-90 days), the insurance company pays benefits up to the policy's daily/monthly maximum for the duration specified in the policy.

### What Policies Typically Cover

Most long-term care policies cover home care, assisted living, and nursing home care. Some older policies have restrictions, so review yours carefully. Benefits may include [home health aides](/services/home-health-aides) and [personal care](/services/personal-care), homemaker services, adult day care, and care coordination.

### How to Access Benefits

Dig out the policy documents (check safe deposit boxes, files, or contact the insurance company directly). File a claim with the insurance company. Complete their assessment process to verify care needs. Once approved, submit invoices from your home care agency for reimbursement, or some policies pay the agency directly.

### Advantages

Long-term care insurance can cover a substantial portion of care costs, sometimes the entire amount depending on the policy. Benefits are typically tax-free.

### Considerations

Policies vary dramatically. Some have generous benefits; others have low daily maximums that don't cover actual costs. Many have lifetime limits. Older policies may have restrictions on what types of care or providers qualify.

If your parent doesn't have a policy, it's likely too late to purchase one affordably—premiums are high for older adults, and those already needing care can't qualify.

### Tips for Using LTC Insurance

Start the claims process early—there's often paperwork and waiting periods. Keep detailed records of all care provided. Understand exactly what your policy covers and any restrictions. Ask your home care agency if they have experience working with insurance companies.

## 3. Veterans Benefits (Aid and Attendance)

If your parent or their spouse served in the military, VA benefits may help pay for home care. The Aid and Attendance benefit is significantly underutilized because many families don't know it exists.

### How It Works

Aid and Attendance is an enhanced VA pension benefit for veterans (and surviving spouses of veterans) who need help with daily activities. It provides monthly cash payments that can be used for home care.

### Eligibility Requirements

**Service requirements:** The veteran must have served at least 90 days of active duty, with at least one day during a wartime period. Wartime periods include World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Gulf War (1990-present).

**Medical requirements:** The claimant must need help with activities of daily living, be bedridden, be a patient in a nursing home, or have limited eyesight.

**Financial requirements:** Income and assets must fall below certain thresholds. However, unreimbursed medical expenses (including home care costs) can be deducted from income for eligibility purposes.

### Benefit Amounts (2024)

Monthly benefit amounts vary by situation. Veterans with a spouse may receive over $2,500 monthly. Single veterans may receive over $2,200 monthly. Surviving spouses may receive over $1,400 monthly. These amounts are adjusted annually.

### How to Apply

Gather military discharge papers (DD-214), medical evidence of care needs, and financial information. Apply through the VA or work with a VA-accredited claims agent or attorney. The process can take several months, so apply early.

### Advantages

Aid and Attendance provides significant monthly income specifically for care needs. Unlike Medicaid, it doesn't require spending down nearly all assets first.

### Considerations

The application process is complex and time-consuming. Many families benefit from professional help navigating it. Benefits aren't retroactive to when care began—only to when you applied—so don't delay.

## 4. Medicaid (NJ FamilyCare)

Medicaid is the joint federal-state program that provides health coverage for low-income individuals. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid does cover home care services. (If you're confused about the difference, see our guide on [what Medicare does and doesn't cover](/blog/does-medicare-cover-home-care-new-jersey).)

### How It Works

New Jersey's Medicaid program (NJ FamilyCare) offers several home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver programs that pay for home care. These programs aim to help people remain at home rather than entering nursing homes.

### Eligibility Requirements

**Financial eligibility:** Strict income and asset limits apply. For 2024, individuals generally must have limited monthly income and assets under $2,000 (excluding home, car, and certain other assets). Rules for married couples are more complex.

**Medical eligibility:** Must demonstrate need for a nursing-home level of care.

### What Medicaid Covers

Eligible individuals may receive personal care services, homemaker services, respite care, adult day care, home modifications, and care management.

### How to Apply

Contact your local County Board of Social Services or NJ FamilyCare to begin the application process. Expect to provide detailed financial documentation.

### Advantages

Medicaid can cover substantial home care costs for those who qualify. Once eligible, out-of-pocket costs are minimal.

### Considerations

The financial eligibility requirements are strict—most middle-class families don't qualify without spending down assets. There may be waiting lists for waiver programs. The application process is complex and documentation-heavy.

### Medicaid Planning

Some families work with elder law attorneys on "Medicaid planning"—legally restructuring assets to qualify for benefits while preserving some resources. This is most effective when done well before care is needed, but strategies exist even when care needs are immediate.

## 5. Home Equity Options

For families whose primary asset is the family home, several options can convert home equity into care funding.

### Reverse Mortgage

A reverse mortgage allows homeowners 62+ to borrow against their home equity without monthly payments. Funds can be received as a lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit.

**Advantages:** Provides access to significant funds without selling the home. No repayment required until the homeowner moves out, sells, or passes away.

**Considerations:** Reduces inheritance for heirs. Fees and interest accumulate. Must maintain home and pay taxes/insurance. Complex product requiring careful evaluation.

### Home Equity Loan or Line of Credit

Traditional home equity borrowing provides funds while requiring monthly payments.

**Advantages:** Lower fees than reverse mortgages. Maintains more equity for heirs if repaid.

**Considerations:** Requires income to qualify and make payments. Adds debt burden during a time of high expenses.

### Selling the Home

If your parent is moving to assisted living or in with family, selling the home frees up equity for care costs.

**Advantages:** Provides a lump sum without ongoing debt. Eliminates home maintenance burden.

**Considerations:** Significant life change. May have tax implications. Eliminates the option of returning home.

## 6. Life Insurance Options

Existing life insurance policies may provide resources for care.

### Accelerated Death Benefits

Many life insurance policies allow policyholders with chronic or terminal illness to access a portion of the death benefit while living. This is sometimes called a "living benefit."

**How it works:** If your parent has a qualifying condition, they may be able to receive 25-100% of the death benefit early to pay for care.

**Considerations:** Reduces or eliminates the death benefit for heirs. May affect Medicaid eligibility. Tax implications vary.

### Life Settlements

A life settlement involves selling a life insurance policy to a third party for more than the cash surrender value but less than the death benefit.

**How it works:** Companies purchase policies from older adults, continue paying premiums, and collect the death benefit when the insured passes.

**Considerations:** Provides a lump sum now, but heirs receive nothing from the policy. May affect Medicaid eligibility. Tax implications apply.

### Policy Loans

If your parent has a whole life policy with cash value, they may be able to borrow against it.

**How it works:** Loans against cash value provide funds without surrendering the policy. Interest accrues, and unpaid loans reduce the death benefit.

**Considerations:** Maintains the policy in force. Interest accumulates. Unpaid loans reduce inheritance.

## 7. Family Contributions and Creative Solutions

Many families piece together funding from multiple sources and family members.

### Sharing Costs Among Siblings

When multiple adult children exist, sharing care costs distributes the burden. Formal agreements help prevent conflicts.

**Approaches:** Equal contributions from each sibling. Proportional contributions based on income/assets. One sibling provides more money, another provides more hands-on help. Regular family meetings to discuss finances and care decisions.

### Family Caregiver Compensation

In some cases, family members providing care can be compensated, creating income for the caregiver while paying for care.

**Medicaid considerations:** If pursuing Medicaid, a formal caregiver agreement is essential. Payments must be reasonable and documented to avoid being seen as asset transfers.

**Tax implications:** Compensation is taxable income for the family caregiver.

### Care Cooperatives

Some families coordinate with neighbors or friends in similar situations to share caregivers or provide mutual support, reducing individual costs.

## Creating Your Payment Strategy

Most families use a combination of these options. Here's how to build your strategy:

**Take inventory.** What resources exist? Savings, insurance policies, home equity, veteran status, income sources? What do family members have available to contribute?

**Calculate realistic costs.** Based on care needs, what will monthly costs likely be? How might needs change over time?

**Match resources to timeline.** How long might care be needed? Which resources are sustainable for that duration?

**Consult professionals.** An elder law attorney can help with Medicaid planning and asset protection. A financial advisor can help optimize resources. A VA-accredited agent can navigate veterans benefits.

**Start with the best options first.** Use benefits that don't deplete assets (insurance, VA) before spending down savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if we can't afford the care my parent needs?**
Start with what you can afford and supplement with family help. Explore all benefit options—many families qualify for programs they didn't know existed. Consider starting with fewer hours and increasing as you secure additional funding. Talk honestly with your home care agency about your budget.

**Should we spend down assets to qualify for Medicaid?**
This depends on your situation. Medicaid planning can preserve some assets while qualifying for benefits, but strategies vary and timing matters. Consult an elder law attorney before making major financial decisions.

**Can I get paid to care for my own parent?**
In some circumstances, yes. Medicaid programs may pay family caregivers. VA benefits can be used to compensate family members. If pursuing this, set up proper agreements and understand tax implications.
