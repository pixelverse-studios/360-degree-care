            'The 360 Degree Care agency has been very professional and proficient when it comes to attending the clients and Aids needs and inquiries. The nurse calls every Tuesdays to check up on the aids, and do home visits to clients homes to check how the client is doing and how the living and work arrangements are going for live-in Aids and clients. They are very supportive and are just a call away whenever you need help or have questions.'

            "360 Degree Care of Ridgewood is so different than other healthcare companies I have used for my mom. The kindness that the whole team has shown my whole family. It was so disturbingly a difficult process when my mom started to need in home care. Fran, 360 Degree Care's nurse had so much information for us . She not only is there for my mom all the time, but any questions I may have along the way she is a help. We started with a Live In caregiver and it was so great to help ease our mind that mom was cared for all the time. As mom was getting better we now use a caregiver that feels like part of the family for 10 hrs a day. I love also that we can reach anyone from the 360 Degree Care Team 24 hrs a day, I speak to them not an answering service. I cant say enough great things about them. Thank you for 360 Degree Care for helping my mom and my family."

            'My father received care from the staff of 360 Degree Care for several years until his passing a couple of months ago. The care team, composed of the nurse, supervisor and health aide dedicated their time in making sure that my father was comfortable and that we had 24 hour care. They were flexible and open to meet our needs as my fathers illness progressed its due course. They were courteous, professional and reliable always. We know that when my mother will not be able to care for herself we will be contacting 360 Degree Care.'

I called in the afternoon of a weekend day requesting someone to help care for my husband overnight while he was hospitalized. They were able to find a very kind and caring woman who was a companion to him until I arrived in the morning. I am very grateful for that.'

The aide was proactive and supportive and did exactly what the agency said she would do over the one month of her engagement. We would not hesitate to engage 360 Degree Care again in the event of a similar need.'

            "If you are reading this, you are searching, possibly desperately, for a dedicated caregiver for your loved one. Please call Jeff and Dina at 360 Degree Care. There is no reason to inquire with any other agency. My father was in the hospital after taking a bad fall. He was already on hospice. I called a few agencies urgently looking for help... a live in aide in less than 48 hours time. I knew I couldn't give the care that was needed. I spoke with both Jeff and Dina and they immediately calmed my fears and felt like family. They provided an aide, more like an angel, within 36 hours of speaking to them. They are special people who care, not only about your loved one, but about you. Please call them."

            'My name is Joan and I am delighted to write a review for 360 Degree Care. Recently I was scheduled to have a knee replacement and my family was going to help me, getting to and from the hospital, and take care of me at home. That plan was interrupted with COVID. I had known of 360 Degree Care and gave them a call the day before my surgery to help me out. Immediately, 360 Degree Care said yes. The day of the surgery they picked me up at 5:30am, bought me to the hospital and stayed until I was in recovery. Jeff and Veronica both came to pick me up from the hospital two day later, they took me home and stayed until my family could come and help me. 360 Degree Care from Jeff, Veronica and Fran, made my experience of surgery so much better. They made me feel safe and cared for. Could not have done this without them. My family is forever grateful that 360 Degree Care was able to step right in and get help for their Mom. (that is me). Thank you 360 Degree Care.'

Aides go above and beyond with their help. And they cared for my animals in an excellent manner. Both ladies are great cooks and are excellent in keeping you on track for recovery. Be it eating healthy or taking medicines they are of the highest quality.'

            'I feel so fortunate to have met Jeff and his staff at 360 Degree Care through his active involvement with the Ridgewood Chamber of Commerce. I honestly can say that my family would not have been able to confront the medical crisis we faced with the peace of mind we had without him and his amazing staff of schedulers, nurses, and incredibly caring professionals. They not only got the job done for us in terms of providing immediate care (amazing how they did it) but did so with compassion, demonstrating dignity to my parents during the entire process. I can scarcely express our deepest gratitude to this tremendous group of devoted professionals. It is clear they love what they are doingproviding positive forces in the lives of the families they help and going over and beyond to do so.'

            'We chose 360 Degree Care to guide us through my dads final months. We started with part time aides, then moved to full time. During a sad and difficult time in our lives, Jeff and his support team were always there. Susie was my dads live in aide. She became part of our family. Her upbeat personality and deep spirituality helped us all. She cared for my dad with cheerful, caring devotion. She always treated him with dignity and respect. She even stayed overnight when Dad was hospitalized. She remained at his side through home hospice and even came to the funeral. He called her "his Susie".'

            '360 Degree Care was a pleasure to work with. They found a aid for us right away. We only needed the aid to do a few things so as such she was finished before her minimum time and she seemed disappointed that we did not have more work for her. She kept wanting to work for the complete minimum billing time even though we were very happy to just have her do what we needed and leave early. When our regular aid was forced to cancel due to a injury 360 Degree Care found a replacement right away. Elise was a pleasure to work with. Always very responsive to our needs.'

This gentleman ( and he was a gentleman) took care of my disabled father with the utmost sensitivity and anticipated his needs. He also watched out for my mother whose disease was making her weaker by the day and would call me when he was concerned about her status. I highly recommend this company. They helped my family through an extremely difficult and emotional time. Thank you Jeff!'
