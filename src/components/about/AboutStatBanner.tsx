                    We believe homecare must go beyond sending someone to do
                    something and sending a bill. We have created Concierge
                    Level Homecare. Meaning we are ready to take care of
                    everything a client or patient needs from the moment they
                    open their eyes in the morning to the memento they close
                    them at nightâ€¦and often for many times they need extra help
                    in between. We cover all of the details, and many more needs
                    that pop up. We believe that we are here to make our clients
                    lives better.

                        facilities that have staffing shortages. Our experience
                        caring for families that have the highest expectations
                        means the staffing we provide to a rehab or subacute or
                        in an assisted living facility can be expected to be of
                        the highest quality.

                        We formerly worked under the Interim Healthcare banner
                        but realized that the added bureaucracy and overhead of
                        a franchise system did not provide enough added value to
                        warrant its continuing. All of our personnel and all of
                        our services remain exactly as before.
