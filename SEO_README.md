# SEO & Localized Content Management: A Deep Dive

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the content and SEO management system for the 360 Degree Care website. It's designed for content managers and SEO specialists to understand how to effectively update and localize content for our target markets.

The entire system is **data-driven**. This means all the text, keywords, and SEO metadata you see on the county and city-specific pages come from a set of structured data files, not from individual page code. This makes managing content across hundreds of potential pages scalable and consistent.

## 1. Core Concepts

### The Data Hierarchy
Our content is structured in a logical hierarchy:

1.  **County**: The highest level, representing a major service region (e.g., Bergen County).
2.  **City**: Each county contains multiple cities or towns (e.g., Ridgewood, Hackensack). Each city has its own unique set of local data.
3.  **Service**: The specific services we offer (e.g., Personal Care, Companion Care). The content for each service can be customized for every single city.

This structure allows us to generate hyper-local landing pages, such as `.../bergen-county/ridgewood/personal-care`, with content specifically tailored to that location and service.

### The Files You'll Work With

-   **Content Hub**: `src/lib/seo/countyData/`
    -   This is your primary workspace. Each file inside (e.g., `bergen-county.ts`) contains all the data for one county and all the cities within it.
-   **Data Blueprints**: `src/lib/types.ts`
    -   This file is your reference guide. It defines the "shape" or structure of all our content objects. If you're ever unsure what a field is called or what kind of data it expects, this is the place to look. You will not need to edit this file.
-   **Service Templates**: `src/lib/seo/serviceTemplates/`
    -   To ensure consistency, we use templates for each service. These files provide a base of content and SEO settings for a service, which you can then override with city-specific details. You will likely not need to edit these files directly, but it's good to know they exist.

## 2. Deep Dive: Data Structures

Understanding these data structures is key to managing the content effectively.

### `CountyData`
This is the top-level object in each county file. It defines the content for the main county landing page (e.g., `/bergen-county`).

**Data Structure (`from src/lib/types.ts`):**
```typescript
export interface CountyData {
    slug: string;
    name: string;
    heroTitle: string;
    heroSubtitle: string;
    introText: string;
    services: Array<{
        slug: string;
        name: string;
        description: string;
    }>;
    cities: CityData[]; // Contains an array of all cities in the county
    cta: {
        heading: string;
        subheading: string;
        buttonText: string;
    };
    ogImage: {
        url: string;
        alt: string;
    };
}
```

**How to Update County Content:**
Open the relevant file (e.g., `src/lib/seo/countyData/bergen-county.ts`) and edit the fields directly. For example, to change the main headline on the Bergen County page, you would edit the `heroTitle` field.

### `CityData`
This is the most important object for localization. It's found within the `cities` array inside a `CountyData` object.

**Data Structure (`from src/lib/types.ts`):**
```typescript
export interface CityData {
    slug: string;
    name: string;
    zipCodes: string[];
    population: string;
    demographics: string;
    localKeywords: string[];
    nearbyAreas: string[];
    localLandmarks: string[];
    customDescriptions: { [key: string]: string | undefined };
    serviceSpecificSEO: { [key: string]: ServiceSEOData | undefined };
    seoContent: LocationSEOContent;
    offeredServices?: string[];
    rankingFactors?: {
        primaryKeywords: string[];
        secondaryKeywords: string[];
        competitionLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
        focusAreas: string[];
    };
}
```

**Key Fields for a UX Designer:**

-   `localKeywords`, `nearbyAreas`, `localLandmarks`: Use these to ground the content in the local context. What do people in this town call the area? What are the major landmarks?
-   `customDescriptions`: This allows you to write a unique short description for a service *as it appears on the main city page*. For example, you can tailor the description of "Companion Care" specifically for Ridgewood.
-   `rankingFactors`: This is for SEO strategy. You can define the target keywords and assess the competition level.
-   `seoContent`: This is for creating rich, paragraph-style content on the city page.
    -   `communityFocus`: Describe the city's personality.
    -   `serviceAreas`: Mention specific neighborhoods or areas you serve within the city.
    -   `localPartners`: Name-drop local hospitals, community centers, etc., to build trust.

### `ServiceSEOData`
This is the most granular level of control. This object lives inside the `serviceSpecificSEO` field of a `CityData` object. It allows you to completely customize the landing page for a *specific service in a specific city*.

**Data Structure (`from src/lib/types.ts`):**
```typescript
export interface ServiceSEOData {
    customDescription?: string;
    customH1?: string;
    customTitle?: string;
    customMetaDescription?: string;
    localKeywords?: string[];
    contentBlocks?: {
        whyChooseUs?: string;
        serviceHighlights?: string[];
        localExpertise?: string;
        emergencyInfo?: string;
    };
    // ... other fields for hero, lists, etc.
}
```

**Key Fields for a UX Designer:**

-   `customH1`, `customTitle`, `customMetaDescription`: These give you full control to override the automatically-generated SEO tags for a page. This is essential for fine-tuning your SEO strategy for high-priority pages.
-   `contentBlocks`: This is where you can add detailed, custom content to the page.
    -   `whyChooseUs`: A compelling reason why a client in this specific city should choose us.
    -   `serviceHighlights`: A bulleted list of key features for this service in this city.
    -   `localExpertise`: A paragraph describing our deep understanding of the local area.
    -   `emergencyInfo`: Information about local emergency services.

## 3. Your Workflow: How to Make Updates

Here are practical, step-by-step examples for common tasks.

### Scenario 1: You want to add a new local keyword for Ridgewood.

1.  Navigate to and open `src/lib/seo/countyData/bergen-county.ts`.
2.  Use `Cmd/Ctrl + F` to find `"slug": "ridgewood"`. This will take you to the `CityData` object for Ridgewood.
3.  Find the `localKeywords` array.
4.  Add your new keyword to the list.

```typescript
// Before
localKeywords: [
    'Ridgewood NJ',
    'Bergen County',
    'downtown Ridgewood',
],

// After
localKeywords: [
    'Ridgewood NJ',
    'Bergen County',
    'downtown Ridgewood',
    'Valley Hospital area care' // Your new keyword
],
```

### Scenario 2: You want to write a completely custom H1 tag and content for "Personal Care" services in Hackensack.

1.  Navigate to and open `src/lib/seo/countyData/bergen-county.ts`.
2.  Find the `CityData` object for Hackensack (`"slug": "hackensack"`).
3.  Find the `serviceSpecificSEO` object within it.
4.  Find the `'personal-care'` entry. It will look something like `addPersonalCare('hackensack', { ... })`.
5.  You will be adding your customizations inside the second argument (the `{...}` part).

**Example:**

```typescript
// Inside the Hackensack CityData object...
serviceSpecificSEO: {
    'personal-care': addPersonalCare('hackensack', {
        // --- Add your customizations here ---
        customH1: 'Expert Personal Care at Home in Hackensack, NJ',
        customMetaDescription: 'With 24/7 support and proximity to HUMC, our personal care services in Hackensack offer unparalleled peace of mind.',
        contentBlocks: {
            whyChooseUs: "Families in Hackensack trust us because our caregivers are deeply familiar with the city's urban environment and have strong ties to the local medical community, including Hackensack University Medical Center.",
            serviceHighlights: [
                'Direct coordination with HUMC discharge planners',
                'Caregivers experienced in high-rise apartment living',
                'Flexible scheduling for busy urban families'
            ]
        }
        // --- End of your customizations ---
    }),
    // ... other services
},
```

By following this structure, you can systematically enhance the website's content, making it more relevant, localized, and effective for SEO.
